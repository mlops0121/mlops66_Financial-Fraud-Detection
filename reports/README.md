# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the

### Question 3
> **Did you end up using any open-source frameworks/packages not covered in the course during your project? If so**
> **which did you use and how did they help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We primarily utilized **pytorch-tabnet**, a specialized deep learning library for tabular data that uses attention mechanisms, allowing us to maintain interpretability while achieving high performance. We also used **Locust** for load testing our API to ensure it could handle concurrent requests. For the API itself, we used **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn** for their high performance and ease of use compared to Flask.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We managed dependencies manually using a `requirements.txt` file. We separated the PyTorch installation instructions in the file header because hardware-specific wheels (CUDA vs CPU) often require different index URLs that `pip` cannot handle automatically in a single file. A new team member would clone the repo, create a virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`), install PyTorch according to their hardware, and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

We started with the cookiecutter template but adapted it significantly. We kept the `src` folder for the core logic (models, features, data). However, we moved the API code to a dedicated `api/` directory at the root level to separate the deployment logic from the training logic. We also added a `docker-entrypoint.sh` for container orchestration and a root-level `locustfile.py` for performance testing, which were not in the original template.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We used **Ruff** and **Black** for linting and code formatting to ensure consistency across the team. We implemented strict type hinting in our configuration (`src/config/settings.py`) and API schemas (`api/schemas.py`) using Pydantic. This typing helped catch errors early in the development process. Documentation was added as docstrings to all major classes in `src/models` and `src/features`.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

We implemented a comprehensive suite of **71 unit tests**. These tests cover every aspect of the pipeline:
1.  **Data & Features:** `test_loader.py`, `test_preprocessor.py`, and `test_encoders.py` ensure robust data transformation.
2.  **Model Logic:** `test_tabnet_trainer.py` and `test_callbacks.py` verify the training loop and early stopping mechanisms.
3.  **API & Utils:** `test_api.py` and `test_settings.py` validate the configuration and inference endpoints.
This extensive testing ensures that individual components function correctly in isolation before integration.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

Our total code coverage is **67%** (574 statements covered out of 862). While this aggregate number appears lower, we achieved 100% coverage on critical modules like config, data (specifically loader.py), and uncertainty, as well as **97%** on the core model training logic (tabnet_trainer.py). The missing lines are primarily concentrated in auxiliary development tools (wandb_utils.py, profiling.py) and offline analysis scripts (dataset_statistics.py) which are not part of the critical inference path.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we strictly followed a feature-branch workflow. Direct pushes to `main` were discouraged. We created branches like `feature/readme-update` or `fix/api-bug`. We utilized GitHub Pull Requests to review code. This allowed us to run our CI pipeline (defined in `.github/workflows/codecheck.yaml`) on the code before it was merged, preventing broken code from reaching the production branch.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we used DVC (Data Version Control) backed by a Google Cloud Storage bucket. We tracked the large CSV files (`train_transaction.csv`, etc.) using `.dvc` files. This allowed us to switch between the full dataset and a smaller subset for debugging simply by checking out different git commits, while keeping our repository size small.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We set up a comprehensive CI pipeline using GitHub Actions with three distinct workflows:
1.  `codecheck.yaml`: Runs linting (Ruff/Black) to ensure code quality.
2.  `tests.yaml`: Runs the `pytest` suite on every push.
3.  `api_tests.yaml`: Specifically tests the API integration.
    We used caching for `pip` dependencies to reduce the runtime of these actions.

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We implemented a centralized configuration class `Config` in `src/config/settings.py`. Instead of using external YAML files (Hydra), we used a pure Python class approach. This allows us to use static typing and IDE autocompletion for configuration parameters. We can override defaults (like `BATCH_SIZE=8192` or `MAX_EPOCHS=100`) by passing arguments to the `Config` constructor at runtime.

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

We secured reproducibility by pinning exact library versions in `requirements.txt`. In our `train.py`, we set global random seeds for `torch`, `numpy`, and `random`. Furthermore, by using DVC, we link specific code commits to specific data versions, ensuring that an experiment run today uses the exact same data and code as an experiment run last week.

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
> **important.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.
>
> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*
>
> Answer:
!TODO LINXIN
`![WandB Metrics](figures/wandb.png)`

We tracked metrics such as Training Loss, Validation AUC, and Learning Rate. The visualization helped us identify that the model converges quickly (around epoch 20) and allowed us to tune the `PATIENCE` parameter for early stopping to save resources.

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We used Docker to containerize the API for deployment. Our `Dockerfile` installs the system dependencies, copies the code, and sets the entry point to `uvicorn`. To run it locally, we use:
`docker build -t fraud-app .`
`docker run -p 8000:8000 fraud-app`
This ensures the application runs exactly the same on our local machines as it does on Google Cloud Run.

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>

For local debugging, we used conversations with LLM either using IDEs or web servivces. Through out the group anti-gravity, Cursor and Co-pilot where used. For cloud/container issues, we relied on application logs. We faced significant issues with PyTorch CUDA versions matching the container drivers, which we resolved by simplifying the Docker image to a CPU-only version for the inference API to reduce image size and complexity.

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

1.  **Google Cloud Storage (Buckets):** For storing the raw data (DVC remote) and model artifacts.
2.  **Artifact Registry:** To store our Docker images pushed by Cloud Build.
3.  **Cloud Build:** To automatically build and push Docker images upon pushes to the main branch.
4.  **Vertex AI:** For training our TabNet model using custom training jobs with GPU support.

### Question 18

> **The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs**
> **you used?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the*
> *using a custom container: ...*


We used **Vertex AI Custom Training** to train our TabNet model in the cloud, which runs on Compute Engine infrastructure. Vertex AI automatically provisions GPU-enabled VMs and manages the lifecycle of these instances. We created a training Docker image (`Dockerfile.train`) based on PyTorch and used `vertex_train.py` to submit custom training jobs. The training container automatically downloads data from our GCP bucket, runs the training script, and uploads the trained model back to the bucket.

### Question 19

> **Insert 1-2 images of your GCP bucket, such that we can see what data you have stored in it.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/bucket.png).**

### Question 21

> **Upload 1-2 images of your GCP cloud build history, so we can see the history of the images that have been build in**
> **your project. You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/build.png).**


[Cloud Build](figures/MLOPS_Cloudbuild.png)

We initially implemented Cloud Build with a `cloudbuild.yaml` configuration file to automatically build and push Docker images to Artifact Registry on code pushes. However, we later removed this setup because we already had Docker image builds integrated into our GitHub Actions workflows (`deploy_cloudrun.yaml` and `api_tests.yaml`). Having both Cloud Build and GitHub Actions build images would have been redundant and added unnecessary complexity. We chose to keep the Docker builds in GitHub Actions to maintain all CI/CD workflows in one place, which simplifies monitoring and reduces the number of services to manage. The screenshot above shows the Cloud Build history from when we tested the implementation.

### Question 22

> **Did you manage to train your model in the cloud using either the Engine or Vertex AI? If yes, explain how you did**
> **it. If not, describe why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine*
> *was because ...*
>

Yes, we trained our model in the cloud using **Vertex AI Custom Training**. We created a training Docker image (`Dockerfile.train`) with GPU support (PyTorch with CUDA 11.8), and developed `vertex_train.py` to submit custom training jobs. The training workflow uses `train_entrypoint.sh` which automatically downloads training data from our GCP bucket, executes the training script, and uploads the trained model and preprocessor back to the bucket. We chose Vertex AI over manually managing Compute Engine VMs because it provides managed infrastructure, automatic resource provisioning, better integration with our MLOps pipeline, and eliminates the need for SSH access and session management.

## Deployment

### Question 23

> **Did you manage to write an API for your model? If yes, explain how you did it and if you did anything special. If**
> **not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...*
> *to the API to make it more ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we built a robust API using **FastAPI** (`api/main.py`). We defined Pydantic models in `api/schemas.py` (`TransactionData`, `PredictionResponse`) to validate input data automatically. The API includes a `/predict` endpoint for single transactions and a `/health` endpoint for readiness probes.

### Question 24

> **Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and**
> **preferably how you invoke your deployed service?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which*
> *worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call*
> *`curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"<weburl>`*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we deployed the API to **Google Cloud Run**. We set up a continuous deployment pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy_cloudrun.yaml`). Whenever we push a new tag or merge to main, GitHub Actions triggers Cloud Build, which builds the image and deploys it to Cloud Run. This gives us a publicly accessible HTTPS URL for our model.

### Question 25

> **Did you perform any unit testing and load testing of your API? If yes, explain how you did it and what results for**
> **the load testing did you get. If not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For unit testing we used ... and for load testing we used ... . The results of the load testing showed that ...*
> *before the service crashed.*
>
> Answer:

Yes. We unit tested the endpoints using `pytest` and `FastAPI.testclient`. For load testing, we included a `locustfile.py` in the root of the repo. We simulated up to 100 concurrent users hitting the `/predict` endpoint. We observed that Cloud Run successfully scaled up instances to handle the traffic, maintaining a response time under 200ms.

### Question 26

> **Did you manage to implement monitoring of your deployed model? If yes, explain how it works. If not, explain how**
> **monitoring would help the longevity of your application.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could*
> *measure ... and ... that would inform us about this ... behaviour of our application.*
>
> Answer:

We rely on the built-in monitoring tools of **Cloud Run**, which provide metrics for request count, latency (95th percentile), and container instance count. We can see error logs directly in the Google Cloud Console. While we didn't implement a custom drift detection dashboard, these system metrics are sufficient to monitor the service's health.

## Overall discussion of project

> In the following section we would like you to think about the general structure of your project.

### Question 27

> **How many credits did you end up using during the project and what service was most expensive? In general what do**
> **you think about working in the cloud?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Group member 1 used ..., Group member 2 used ..., in total ... credits was spend during development. The service*
> *costing the most was ... due to ... . Working in the cloud was ...*
>
> Answer:

We used approximately **$ 0.05** in credits. The primary cost driver was the GPU-enabled Compute Engine instance used for development and training. Cloud Run costs were low due to its scale-to-zero nature, and Storage costs were negligible. Working in the cloud significantly accelerated our training time compared to local CPUs.

Full cost breakdown can be seen in:

### Question 28

> **Did you implement anything extra in your project that is not covered by other questions? Maybe you implemented**
> **a frontend for your API, use extra version control features, a drift detection service, a kubernetes cluster etc.**
> **If yes, explain what you did and why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We implemented a frontend for our API. We did this because we wanted to show the user ... . The frontend was*
> *implemented using ...*
>
> Answer:

We implemented two significant extensions:
1. **Uncertainty Analysis:** We added a module (`src/evaluation/uncertainty.py`) that categorizes predictions into risk levels (High, Medium, Low) based on probability thresholds, providing actionable insights beyond raw scores.
2. **Frontend Interface:** We developed a web-based frontend (branch `API-web`) that connects to our API. It includes a health check endpoint and visualizes fraud probabilities using graphs, rendering the model results accessible to non-technical users.

### Question 29

> **Include a figure that describes the overall architecture of your system and what services that you make use of.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/overview.png). Additionally, in your own words, explain the**

> Answer:

[Architecture Overview](figures/overview.png)

The diagram illustrates our flow:
1.  **Dev:** Code pushed to GitHub triggers Actions (Tests).
2.  **Data:** Large files are synced to GCS via DVC.
3.  **Build:** Cloud Build creates the Docker container.
4.  **Train:** Compute Engine pulls data and code to train the model.
5.  **Deploy:** The trained model is packaged and served via Cloud Run.

> Answer:

One of the main struggles was managing the dependencies between the heavy training environment (GPU, CUDA, PyTorch) and the lightweight inference environment. We initially tried to use one Docker image for both, which resulted in a massive image size (>4GB) that was slow to deploy. We resolved this by optimizing the inference requirements to be CPU-only and stripping unnecessary dev dependencies.
